# Memory Benchmark

The `MemoryBenchmark.ino` was compiled with each `FEATURE_*` and the flash
memory and static RAM sizes were recorded. The `FEATURE_BASELINE` selection is
the baseline, and its memory usage  numbers are subtracted from the subsequent
`FEATURE_*` memory usage.

**Version**: AceTime v1.7.4

**DO NOT EDIT**: This file was auto-generated using `make README.md`.

## How to Regenerate

To regenerate this README.md:

```
$ make clean_benchmarks
$ make benchmarks
$ make README.md
```

The `make benchmarks` target uses `collect.sh` script which calls `auniter.sh`
(https://github.com/bxparks/AUniter) to invoke the Arduino IDE programmatically.
It produces a `*.txt` file with the flash and ram usage information (e.g.
`nano.txt`). It now takes about 16 minutes to generate the `*.txt` files on my
quad-core Intel Core i7-3840QM CPU @ 2.80GHz laptop.

The `make README.md` command calls the `generated_readme.py` Python script which
generates this `README.md` file. The ASCII tables below are generated by the
`generate_table.awk` script, which takes each `*.txt` file and converts it to an
ASCII table.

## Library Size Changes

In v1.3, the `BasicZoneManager` and `ExtendedZoneManager` classes were unified
under a new parent interface `ZoneManager`. This seems to have caused the flash
size to increase by around 1200 bytes on the AVR processors (Nano, Pro Micro),
about 500 bytes on a SAMD, about 800 bytes on a ESP8266, 100 bytes on a ESP32,
and 1400 bytes on a Teensy 3.2. The 8-bit processors suffer the most
flash size increase proportional to their limited 32kB limit.

Adding the `ZoneManager` interface simplifies a lot of the complexity with
saving and restoring time zones using the `TimeZoneData` object, and I think it
is worth the extra cost of flash size. The mitigating factor is that
applications targetted towards 8-bit processors will normally have fixed number
of timezones at compile time, so they can avoid using a `ZoneManager`, and avoid
this penalty in flash size.

In v1.4.1+, we removed the `ZoneInfo::transitionBufSize` field from the
`ZoneInfo` struct, which saves 1 byte on 8-bit processors (none on 32-bit
processors due to 4-byte alignment). We save 266 bytes for `BasicZoneManager`
and 386 bytes for `ExtendedZoneManager` when all the zones are loaded into the
zone registry.

Also for v1.4.1+, incorporating zoneName compression causes flash/ram usage to
increase by ~250/120 bytes when using only 1-2 zones, but *decreases* flash
consumption by 1200-2400 bytes when all the zones are loaded into the
`ZoneManager`.

In v1.5+, changing just a single method, `ZoneProcessorCache::getType()`, from a
`virtual` to a non-virtual method saves 250-350 bytes of flash memory when using
a `BasicZoneManager` or an `ExtendedZoneManager` on an 8-bit AVR processor.
Unexpectedly, the flash memory consumption *increases* slightly (~0-50 bytes)
for some ARM processors and the ESP32. Since those processors have far more
flash memory, this seems like a good tradeoff.

Also in v1.5+, changing `BasicZoneProcessor` and `ExtendedZoneProcessor` to be
subclasses of the templatized `BasicZoneProcessorTemplate` and
`ExtendedZoneProcessorTemplate` classes causes reduction of flash consumption by
250-400 bytes for 32-bit processors. Don't know why. (Very little difference for
8-bit AVR). Adding a `BrokerFactory` layer of indirection (to support more
complex ZoneProcessors and Brokers) causes flash memory to go up by 100-200
bytes.

In v1.6, support for `LinkRegistry` was added to `BasicZoneManager` and
`ExtendedZoneManager`. This increases the flash memory usage by 150-500 bytes
when using one of these classes due to the code required by `LinkRegistrar`.
This extra cost is incurred even if the `LinkRegistry` is set to 0 elements.
Each `LinkEntry` consumes 8 bytes (2 x `uint32_t`). So a `zonedb::kLinkRegistry`
with 183 elements uses 1464 extra bytes of flash; a `zonedbx::kLinkRegistry`
with 207 elements uses 1656 extra bytes.

In v1.7, the virtual destructor on the `Clock` base class was removed. This
reduced the flash usage by 618 bytes on AVR processors , 328 bytes on the
SAMD21, but only 50-60 bytes on other 32-bit processors. The various
`printShortNameTo()` or `printShortTo()` methods were changed to replace the
underscore in the zone names (e.g. `Los_Angeles`) with spaces (e.g. `Los
Angeles`) to be more human friendly. This made little difference in the flash
memory consumption, except on the ESP32 where it increased by 200-300 bytes.

In v1.7.2, the `SystemClock::clockMillis()` became non-virtual, using
compile-time polymorphism through C++ template, and incorporating the same
techniques from AceRoutine v1.3. Saves about 20-40 bytes of flash.

In v1.7.4+, `ExtendedZoneProcessor.compareTransitionToMatch()` was modified to
detect an exact equality between a `Transition` and its `MatchingEra` if any of
the 3 time stamp versions ('w', 's', 'u') are equal. Adds about 120-150 bytes of
flash on 8-bit and 32-bit processors. But removing `originalTransitionTime` from
`Transition` decreases flash usage by about 20 bytes.
