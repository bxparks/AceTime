    # Tried to use
    # https://github.com/actions/checkout#Checkout-multiple-repos-side-by-side,
    # but it looks like GITHUB_WORKSPACE is set to
    # /home/runner/work/AceTime/AceTime, so if path is set to 'main' as
    # suggested in the article, then the repo location is set to
    # /home/runner/work/Acetime/AceTime/main/AceTime, which is really
    # confusing. Instead, use 'cd ..' to go up a level and call 'git clone'
    # manually.

    # fail because they depend on the obsolete TZ database on the host
