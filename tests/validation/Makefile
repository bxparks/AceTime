# Build the BasicHinnantDateTest and ExtendedHinnantDateTest tests in series
# (because parallel make of the two targets seem to collide while loading the
# TZ database into Hinnant date library). The Hinnant date library is the only
# one that can be configured to use the new TZ database version just after it
# is released. The other ones require the corresponding package (e.g. OS, Java,
# Python) to be released.

# Build the validation tests in series. This was the original 'tests' target
# but as the validation tests grow slower and slower (mostly due to the new
# implementation of compare_pytz and compare_dateutil), I wrote the paralel
# version above to utilize multiple CPUs. I thought the serial version would be
# useful for GitHub Actions, but even there it seems like the workflow runners
# are allocated least 2 CPUs, and using the parallel version above reduces the
# execution time from 11 min (serial) to 6 min (parallel). So I ended up just
# using the parallel version even for Actions workflow. This target is retained
# for historical reference.
