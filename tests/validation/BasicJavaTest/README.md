# BasicJavaTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`BasicZoneProcessor` class (which uses the `zonedb` data files) with the
`validation_data.cpp` file generated by the Java
`../../tools/compare_java/GenerateData.java` program.

## Running the Test

The Java tool generates about 130,000 data points spanning the year 2000 to
2050. It is too large to run on any Arduino board that I am aware of, including
the ESP32. However it does run on a Linux machine using the
[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.

Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:
```
$ make clean
$ make -j 4

$ make runtests

## Java JDK Version

The TZ Database version used by the `GenerateData.java` program and the
version that generated the `zonedbx` files must match for this unit test to
succeed. For example, one of JDK versions used to run this test was `openjdk
version "11.0.3" 2019-04-16` (see `java -version`) which seems to use version
2018g. So the `Makefile generates the zoneinfo files for `2018g` specifically
for this test.

## Compiling the Java Generator

The `Makefile` assumes that you have already compiled the
`GenerateData.java` program into `GenerateData.class`. Type the
following if you have not done so:
```
$ cd ../../../tools/compare_java
$ make
