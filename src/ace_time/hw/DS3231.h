/**
 * A class that reads and writes HardwareDateTime and HardwareTemperature from a
 * DS3231 RTC chip. This class is designed to access just enough features of the
 * DS3231 chip to implement the ace_time::DS3231Clock class. It is not
 * meant to provide access to all the features of the DS3231 chip. There are
 * other libraries which are far better for that purpose.
 *
 * According to https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-addresses/the-list, the DS3231
 * is always on I2C address 0x68, so let's hardcode that.
 *
 * This class will probably work for the DS1307 and DS3232 RTC chips (except
 * for the temperature function on the DS1307 which lacks this functionality)
 * but this has not been verified.
