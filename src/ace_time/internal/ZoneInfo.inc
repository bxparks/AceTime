 * determined by the RULES column in the TZ Database file.
 *
 * There are 2 types of ZoneEra:
 *    1) zonePolicy == nullptr. Then deltaCode determines the additional offset
 *    from offsetCode. A value of '-' in the TZ Database file is stored as 0.
 *    2) zonePolicy != nullptr. Then the deltaCode offset is given by the
 *    ZoneRule.deltaCode of the ZoneRule which matches the time instant of

   *
   *  1) A fixed string, e.g. "GMT".
   *  2) Two strings separated by a '/', e.g. "-03/-02" indicating
   *     "{std}/{dst}" options.
   *  3) A single string with a substitution, e.g. "E%sT", where the "%s" is
   *  replaced by the LETTER value from the ZoneRule.
   *
   * BasicZoneProcessor supports only a single letter subsitution from LETTER,
   * but ExtendedZoneProcessor supports substituting multi-character strings
   * (e.g. "CAT", "DD", "+00").
   *
   * The TZ DB files use '%s' to indicate the substitution, but for simplicity,
   * AceTime replaces the "%s" with just a '%' character with no loss of
   * functionality. This also makes the string-replacement code a little
   * simpler. For example, 'E%sT' is stored as 'E%T', and the LETTER
   * substitution is performed on the '%' character.
   *
   * This field will never be a 'nullptr' if it was derived from an actual
   * entry from the TZ dtabase. There is an internal object named
   * `ExtendedZoneProcessor::kAnchorEra` which does set this field to nullptr.
   * Maybe it should be set to ""?
