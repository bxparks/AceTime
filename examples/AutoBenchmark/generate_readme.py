# Auto Benchmark

Here are the results from `AutoBenchmark.ino` for various boards.
These results show that integer division and modulus operations are incredibly
slow on 8-bit AVR processors.

**Version**: AceTime v2.3.0

**NOTE**: This file was auto-generated using `make README.md`. DO NOT EDIT.

## Dependencies

This program depends on the following libraries:

* [AceTime](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime)
* [AceRoutine](https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine)

## How to Generate

This requires the [AUniter](https://github.com/bxparks/AUniter) script
to execute the Arduino IDE programmatically.

The `Makefile` has rules to generate the `*.txt` results file for several
microcontrollers that I usually support, but the `$ make benchmarks` command
does not work very well because the USB port of the microcontroller is a
dynamically changing parameter. I created a semi-automated way of collect the
`*.txt` files:

1. Connect the microcontroller to the serial port. I usually do this through a
USB hub with individually controlled switch.
2. Type `$ auniter ports` to determine its `/dev/ttyXXX` port number (e.g.
`/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`).
3. If the port is `USB0` or `ACM0`, type `$ make nano.txt`, etc.
4. Switch off the old microontroller.
5. Go to Step 1 and repeat for each microcontroller.

The `generate_table.awk` program reads one of `*.txt` files and prints out an
ASCII table that can be directly embedded into this README.md file. For example
the following command produces the table in the Nano section below:

```
$ ./generate_table.awk < nano.txt
```

Fortunately, we no longer need to run `generate_table.awk` for each `*.txt`
file. The process has been automated using the `generate_readme.py` script which
will be invoked by the following command:
```
$ make README.md
```

The CPU times below are given in microseconds.

## CPU Time Changes

**v0.8 to v1.4:**
* The CPU time did not change much from

**v1.5:**
* No significant changes to CPU time.
* Zone registries (kZoneRegistry, kZoneAndLinkRegistry) are now sorted by zoneId
  instead of zoneName, and the `ZoneManager::createForZoneId()` will use a
  binary search, instead of a linear search. This makes it 10-15X faster for
  ~266 entries.
* The `ZoneManager::createForZoneName()` also converts to a zoneId, then
  performs a binary search, instead of doing a binary search on the zoneName
  directly. Even with the extra level of indirection, the `createForZoneName()`
  is between 1.5-2X faster than the previous version.

**v1.6:**
* BasicZoneManager and ExtendedZoneManager can take an optional
  LinkRegistry which will be searched if a zoneId is not found. The
  `BasicZoneManager::createForZoneId(link)` benchmark shows that if the zoneId
  is not found, the total search time is roughly double, because the
  LinkRegistry must be search as a fallback.
* On some compilers, the `BasicZoneManager::createForZoneName(binary)` becames
  slightly slower (~10%?) because the algorithm was moved into the
  `ace_common::binarySearchByKey()` template function, and the compiler is not
  able to optimize the resulting function as well as the hand-rolled version.
  The slightly decrease in speed seemed acceptable cost to reduce duplicate code
  maintenance.

**v1.7.2:**
* `SystemClock::clockMillis()` became non-virtual after incorporating
  AceRoutine v1.3. The sizeof `SystemClockLoop` and `SystemClockCoroutine`
  decreases 4 bytes on AVR, and 4-8 bytes on 32-bit processors. No signficant
  changes in CPU time.

**v1.7.5:**
* significant changes to size of `ExtendedZoneProcessor`
    * 8-bit processors
        * increases by 24 bytes on AVR, due adding 1 pointer and 2
            `uint16_t` to MatchingEra
        * decreases by 48 bytes on AVR, by disabling
            `originalTransitionTime` unless
            `ACE_TIME_EXTENDED_ZONE_PROCESSOR_DEBUG` is enabled.
    * 32-bit processors
        * increases by 32 bytes on 32-bit processors due to adding
            a pointer and 2 `uint16_t` to MatchingEra
        * decreases by 32 bytes on 32-bit processors due to disabling
            `originalTransitionTime` in Transition
* Upgrade ESP8266 Core from 2.7.4 to 3.0.2.
    * AutoBenchmark indicate that things are a few percentage faster.

**v1.8.0:**
* Remove `sizeof()` Clock classes which were moved to AceTimeClock library.
* No significant changes to excution times of various benchmarks.

**v1.9.0:**
* Extract `BasicZoneProcessorCache<SIZE>` and `ExtendedZoneProcessorCache<SIZE>`
  from `BasicZoneManager` and `ExtendedZoneManager`. Remove all pure `virtual`
  methods from `ZoneManager`, making ZoneManager hierarchy non-polymorphic.
    * Saves 1100-1300 of flash on AVR.
    * No signficant changes to CPU performance.

**v1.10.0:**
* Remove support for SAMD21 boards.
    * Arduino IDE 1.8.19 with SparkFun SAMD 1.8.6 can no longer upload binaries
      to these boards. Something about bossac 1.7.0 not found.
* Upgrade tool chain:
    * Arduino IDE from 1.8.13 to 1.8.19
    * Arduino AVR from 1.8.3 to 1.8.4
    * STM32duino from 2.0.0 to 2.2.0
    * ESP32 from 1.0.6 to 2.0.2
    * Teensyduino from 1.55 to 1.56
* Add benchmarks for `ZonedDateTime::forComponents()`.
* Add support for `fold` parameter in `LocalDateTime`, `OffsetDateTime`,
  `ZonedDateTime`, and `ExtendedZoneProcessor`.
    * The `ZonedDateTime::forComponents()` can be made much faster using 'fold'.
    * We know exactly when we must normalize and when we can avoid
      normalization.
    * 5X faster on AVR processors when cached, and
    * 1.5-3X faster on 32-bit processors.

**v1.11.0:**
* Upgrade ZoneInfo database so that Links are symbolic links to Zones, instead
  of hard links to Zones.
    * No significant changes to CPU benchmarks.

**v1.11.5**
* Upgrade tool chain
    * Arduino CLI from 0.20.2 to 0.27.1
    * Arduino AVR Core from 1.8.4 to 1.8.5
    * STM32duino from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0
    * ESP32 Core from 2.0.2 to 2.0.5
    * Teensyduino from 1.56 to 1.57
* Upgrade TZDB from 2022b to 2022d

**v2.0**
* Use `int16_t` year fields.
* Implement adjustable epoch year.
* Upgrade to TZDB 2022f.
* AVR:
    * sizeof(LocalDate) increases from 3 to 4
    * sizeof(BasicZoneProcessor) increases from 116 to 122
    * sizeof(ExtendedZoneProcessor) increases from 436 to 468
    * sizeof(TransitionStorage) increases from 340 to 364
    * ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds() slower by 5-10%
* ESP8266
    * sizeof(LocalDate) increases from 3 to 4
    * sizeof(BasicZoneProcessor) remains at 164
    * sizeof(ExtendedZoneProcessor) increases from 540 to 588
    * sizeof(TransitionStorage) increases from 420 to 452
    * ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds() slower by 0-10%

**v2.1.1**
* Upgrade to TZDB 2022g.
* Add `ZonedExtra`.
* Unify fat and symbolic links.
* Not much difference in execution times, except:
    * `ZonedDateTime::forComponents()` using the `BasicZoneProcessor`
      becomes ~50% slower due to the extra work needed to resolve gaps and
      overlaps.
    * `ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds()` using `BasicZoneProcessors` remains
      unchanged.
    * `ExtendedZoneProcessor` is substantially faster on AVR processors.
       Maybe it should be recommended ove `BasicZoneProcessor` even on AVR.

* Upgrade tool chain
    * Arduino AVR from 1.8.5 to 1.8.6
    * STM32duino from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0

    * Seeeduino 1.8.3
* Upgrade to TZDB 2023b

**v2.2.2**
* Upgrade to TZDB 2023c

**v2.2.3**
* Add support for Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4
    * Using Adafruit SAMD Boards 1.7.11
* Remove Teensy 3.2
    * Nearing end of life. Moved to Tier 2 (should work).
* Upgrade tool chain
    * Seeeduino SAMD Boards 1.8.4
    * STM32duino Boards 2.5.0
    * ESP32 Boards 2.0.9

**v2.3.0**

* Add benchmarks for `CompleteZoneProcessor` and related classes
* Replace labels of `BasicZoneManager::createForXxx()` with
  `BasicZoneRegistrar::findIndexForXxx()`, because those are the methods which
  are actually being tested.
