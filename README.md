# AceTime

This library provides date and time classes for the Arduino platform with
support for time zones in the [IANA TZ
database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). Date and time from one timezone can
be converted to another timezone. The library also provides a SystemClock that
can be synchronized from a more reliable external time source, such as an
[NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) server or a [DS3231
RTC](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/real-time-clocks/DS3231.html)
chip. This library can be an alternative to the [Arduino
Time](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time) and [Arduino
Timezone](https://github.com/JChristensen/Timezone) libraries.

        * `ace_time::zonedb::kZoneAfrica_Accra`
        * ...
        * `ace_time::zonedb::kZonePacific_Wake`
        * `ace_time::zonedb::kZonePacific_Wallis`

        * `ace_time::zonedbx::kZoneAfrica_Abidjan`
        * `ace_time::zonedbx::kZoneAfrica_Accra`
        * ...

        * `ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock`
        * `ace_time::clock::NtpClock`
        * `ace_time::clock::SystemClock`
            * `ace_time::clock::SystemClockCoroutine`
            * `ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop`
* internal helper classes (not normally used by app developers)
    * `ace_time::basic::ZoneContext`
    * `ace_time::basic::ZoneEra`
    * `ace_time::basic::ZoneInfo`
    * `ace_time::basic::ZonePolicy`
    * `ace_time::basic::ZoneRule`
    * `ace_time::extended::ZoneContext`
    * `ace_time::extended::ZoneInfo`
    * `ace_time::extended::ZoneEra`
    * `ace_time::extended::ZonePolicy`
    * `ace_time::extended::ZoneRule`

The "date and time" classes provide an abstraction layer to make it easier
to use and manipulate date and time fields. For example, each of the
`LocalDateTime`, `OffsetDateTime` and `ZonedDateTime` classes provide the
`toEpochSeconds()` method which returns the number of seconds from an epoch
date, the `forEpochSeconds()` method which constructs the date and time fields
from the epoch seconds, the `forComponents()` method which constructs the object
from the individual (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) components, and the
`dayOfWeek()` method which returns the day of the week of the given date.

The Epoch in AceTime is defined to be 2000-01-01T00:00:00Z, in contrast to the
Epoch in Unix which is 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Internally, the current time is
represented as "seconds from Epoch" stored as a 32-bit signed integer
(`acetime_t` aliased to `int32_t`). The smallest 32-bit signed integer (`-2^31`)
is used to indicate an internal Error condition, so the range of valid
`acetime_t` value is `-2^31+1` to `2^31-1`. Therefore, the range of dates that
the `acetime_t` type can handle is 1931-12-13T20:45:53Z to 2068-01-19T03:14:07Z
(inclusive). (In contrast, the 32-bit Unix `time_t` range is
1901-12-13T20:45:52Z to 2038-01-19T03:14:07Z which is the cause of the [Year
2038 Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem)).

The various date classes (`LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `OffsetDateTime`,
`ZonedDateTime`) store the year component internally as a signed 8-bit integer
offset from the year 2000. The range of this integer is -128 to +127, but -128
is used to indicate an internal Error condition, so the actual range is -127 to
+127. Therefore, these classes can represent dates from 1873-01-01T00:00:00 to
2127-12-31T23:59:59 (inclusive). Notice that these classes can represent all
dates that can be expressed by the `acetime_t` type, but the reverse is not
true. There are date objects that cannot be converted into a valid `acetime_t`
value. To be safe, users of this library should stay at least 1 day away from
the lower and upper limits of `acetime_t` (i.e. stay within the year 1932 to
2067 inclusive).

The `ZonedDateTime` class works with the `TimeZone` class to implement the DST
transition rules defined by the TZ Database. It also allows conversions to other
timezones using the `ZonedDateTime::convertToTimeZone()` method.

The library provides 2 sets of zoneinfo files created from the IANA TZ Database:

* [zonedb/zone_infos.h](src/ace_time/zonedb/zone_infos.h) contains `kZone*`
  declarations (e.g. `kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles`) for 270 zones and 182 links
  from the year 2000 until 2050. These zones have (relatively) simple time zone
  transition rules, which can handled by the `BasicZoneProcessor` class.
* [zonedbx/zone_infos.h](src/ace_time/zonedbx/zone_infos.h) contains `kZone*`
  declarations (e.g. `kZoneAfrica_Casablanca`) for 387 zones and 205 links in
  the TZ Database (essentially the entire database) from the year 2000 until
  2050. These are intended to be used with the `ExtendedZoneProcessor` class.

The zoneinfo files (and their associated `ZoneProcessor` classes) have a
resolution of 1 minute, which is sufficient to represent all UTC offsets and DST
shifts of all timezones after 1972 (Africa/Monrovia was the last timezone to
switch to UTC time on Jan 7, 1972). These zoneinfo files and the algorithms in
this library have been validated to match the UTC offsets calculated using 3
other date/time libraries:

* the Python [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) library from
  the year 2000 until 2037 (inclusive),
* the Java JDK 11
  [java.time](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/package-summary.html)
  library from year 2000 to 2049 (inclusive),
* the C++11/14/17 [Hinnant date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date) libary
  from year 1975 to 2049 (inclusive).

Custom datasets with smaller or larger range of years may be generated by
developers using scripts provided in this library (although this is not
documented currently). The target application may be compiled against the custom
dataset instead of using `zonedb::` and `zonedbx::` zone files provided in this
library.

It is expected that most applications using AceTime will use only a small number
of timezones at the same time (1 to 3 zones have been extensively tested) and
that this set is known at compile-time. The C++ compiler will include only the
subset of zoneinfo files needed to support those timezones, instead of compiling
in the entire TZ Database. But on microcontrollers with enough memory, the
`ZoneManager` can be used to load the entire TZ Database into the app and
the `TimeZone` objects can be dynamically created as needed.

Each timezone in the TZ Database is identified by its fully qualified zone name
(e.g. `"America/Los_Angeles"`). On small microcontroller environments, these
strings can consume precious memory (e.g. 30 bytes for
`"America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires"`) and are not convenient to serialize over the
network or to save to EEPROM. Therefore, the AceTime library provides each
timezone with an alternative `zoneId` identifier of type `uint32_t` which is
guaranteed to be unique and stable. A `TimeZone` object can be saved as a
`zoneId` and then recreated using the `ZoneManager::createFromZoneId()` method.

The `ace_time::clock` classes collaborate together to implement the
SystemClock which can obtain its time from various sources, such as a DS3231 RTC
chip, or an Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. Retrieving the current time
from accurate clock sources can be expensive, so the `SystemClock` uses the
built-in `millis()` function to provide fast access to a reasonably accurate
clock, but synchronizes to more accurate clocks periodically.

This library does not perform dynamic allocation of memory so that it can be
used in small microcontroller environments. In other words, it does not call the
`new` operator nor the `malloc()` function, and it does not use the Arduino
`String` class. Everything it needs is allocated statically at initialization
time.

The zoneinfo files are stored in flash memory (using the `PROGMEM` compiler
directive) if the microcontroller allows it (e.g. AVR, ESP8266) so that they do
not consume static RAM. The [MemoryBenchmark](examples/MemoryBenchmark/)
program shows that:

* 270 timezones supported by `BasicZoneProcessor`consume about:
    * 15 kB of flash on an 8-bit processor (AVR)
    * 20 kB of flash on a 32-bit processor (ESP8266)
* 387 timezones supported by `ExtendedZoneProcessor` consume:
    * 24 kB of flash on an 8-bit processor (AVR)
    * 33 kB of flash on a 32-bit processor (ESP8266)

Normally a small application will use only a small number of timezones. The
AceTime library with one timezone using the `BasicZoneProcessor` and the
`SystemClock` consumes:
* 9-10 kB of flash and 350 bytes of RAM on an 8-bit AVR processors,
* 6-22 kB of flash and 900-1800 bytes of RAM on a 32-bit processors.

An example of more complex application is the [WorldClock](examples/WorldClock)
which has 3 OLED displays over SPI, 3 timezones using `BasicZoneProcessor`, a
`SystemClock` synchronized to a DS3231 chip on I2C, and 2 buttons with
debouncing and event dispatching provided by the
[AceButton](https://github.com/bxparks/AceButton) library. This application fits
inside the 30 kB flash size of an Arduino Pro Micro controller.

Conversion from date-time components (year, month, day, etc) to epochSeconds
(`ZonedDateTime::toEpochSeconds()`) takes about:
* 90 microseconds on an 8-bit AVR processor,
* 14 microseconds on an SAMD21,
* 7 microseconds on an ESP8266,
* 1.4 microseconds on an ESP32,
* 0.5 microseconds on a Teensy 3.2.

Conversion from an epochSeconds to date-time components including timezone
(`ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds()`) takes (assuming cache hits):
* 600 microseconds on an 8-bit AVR,
* 50 microseconds on an SAMD21,
* 27 microseconds on an ESP8266,
* 2.8 microseconds on an ESP32,
* 6 microseconds on a Teensy 3.2.

**Version**: 1.0 (2019-10-02, TZ DB version 2019c)

**Status**: Graduated to v1.0.

## Examples

### HelloDateTime

Here is a simple program (see [examples/HelloDateTime](examples/HelloDateTime))
which demonstrates how to create and manipulate date and times in different time
zones:

```C++
#include <AceTime.h>

using namespace ace_time;

// ZoneProcessor instances should be created statically at initialization time.
static BasicZoneProcessor pacificProcessor;
static BasicZoneProcessor londonProcessor;

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial); // Wait until Serial is ready - Leonardo/Micro

  auto pacificTz = TimeZone::forZoneInfo(&zonedb::kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles,
        &pacificProcessor);
  auto londonTz = TimeZone::forZoneInfo(&zonedb::kZoneEurope_London,
        &londonProcessor);

  // Create from components. 2019-03-10T03:00:00 is just after DST change in
  // Los Angeles (2am goes to 3am).
  auto startTime = ZonedDateTime::forComponents(
      2019, 3, 10, 3, 0, 0, pacificTz);

  Serial.print(F("Epoch Seconds: "));
  acetime_t epochSeconds = startTime.toEpochSeconds();
  Serial.println(epochSeconds);

  Serial.print(F("Unix Seconds: "));
  acetime_t unixSeconds = startTime.toUnixSeconds();
  Serial.println(unixSeconds);

  Serial.println(F("=== Los_Angeles"));
  auto pacificTime = ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds(epochSeconds, pacificTz);
  Serial.print(F("Time: "));
  pacificTime.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();

  Serial.print(F("Day of Week: "));
  Serial.println(
      DateStrings().dayOfWeekLongString(pacificTime.dayOfWeek()));

  // Print info about UTC offset
  TimeOffset offset = pacificTime.timeOffset();
  Serial.print(F("Total UTC Offset: "));
  offset.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();

  // Print info about the current time zone
  Serial.print(F("Zone: "));
  pacificTz.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();

  // Print the current time zone abbreviation, e.g. "PST" or "PDT"
  Serial.print(F("Abbreviation: "));
  Serial.print(pacificTz.getAbbrev(epochSeconds));
  Serial.println();

  // Create from epoch seconds. London is still on standard time.
  auto londonTime = ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds(epochSeconds, londonTz);

  Serial.println(F("=== London"));
  Serial.print(F("Time: "));
  londonTime.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();

  // Print info about the current time zone
  Serial.print(F("Zone: "));
  londonTz.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();

  // Print the current time zone abbreviation, e.g. "PST" or "PDT"
  Serial.print(F("Abbreviation: "));
  Serial.print(londonTz.getAbbrev(epochSeconds));
  Serial.println();

  Serial.println(F("=== Compare ZonedDateTime"));
  Serial.print(F("pacificTime.compareTo(londonTime): "));
  Serial.println(pacificTime.compareTo(londonTime));
  Serial.print(F("pacificTime == londonTime: "));
  Serial.println((pacificTime == londonTime) ? "true" : "false");
}

void loop() {
}
```

Running this should produce the following on the Serial port:
```
Epoch Seconds: 605527200
Unix Seconds: 1552212000
=== Los Angeles
Time: 2019-03-10T03:00:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
Day of Week: Sunday
Total UTC Offset: -07:00
Zone: America/Los_Angeles
Abbreviation: PDT
=== London
Time: 2019-03-10T10:00:00+00:00[Europe/London]
Zone: Europe/London
Abbreviation: GMT
=== Compare ZonedDateTime
pacificTime.compareTo(londonTime): 0
pacificTime == londonTime: false
```

### HelloZoneManager

The [examples/HelloZoneManager](examples/HelloZoneManager) example shows how to
load the entire TZ Database into a `BasicZoneManager`, then create 3 time zones
using 3 different ways: `createForZoneInfo()`, `createForZoneName()`, and
`createForZoneId()`.

```C++
#include <AceTime.h>

using namespace ace_time;

// Create a BasicZoneManager with the entire TZ Database.
static const int CACHE_SIZE = 3;
static BasicZoneManager<CACHE_SIZE> manager(
  zonedb::kZoneRegistrySize, zonedb::kZoneRegistry);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial); // Wait Serial is ready - Leonardo/Micro

  // Create Los Angeles by ZoneInfo
  auto pacificTz = manager.createForZoneInfo(&zonedb::kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles);
  auto pacificTime = ZonedDateTime::forComponents(
      2019, 3, 10, 3, 0, 0, pacificTz);
  pacificTime.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();

  // Create London by ZoneName
  auto londonTz = manager.createForZoneName("Europe/London");
  auto londonTime = pacificTime.convertToTimeZone(londonTz);
  londonTime.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();

  // Create Sydney by ZoneId
  uint32_t syndeyId = BasicZone(&zonedb::kZoneAustralia_Sydney).zoneId();
  auto sydneyTz = manager.createForZoneId(syndeyId);
  auto sydneyTime = pacificTime.convertToTimeZone(sydneyTz);
  sydneyTime.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();
}

void loop() {
}
```

This consumes about 25kB of flash, which means that it can run on an
Arduino Nano or Micro . It produces the following output:
```
2019-03-10T03:00:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
2019-03-10T10:00:00+00:00[Europe/London]
2019-03-10T21:00:00+11:00[Australia/Sydney]
```

### HelloSystemClock

This is the example code for using the `SystemClock` taken from
[examples/HelloSystemClock](examples/HelloSystemClock).

```C++
#include <AceTime.h>

using namespace ace_time;
using namespace ace_time::clock;

// ZoneProcessor instances should be created statically at initialization time.
static BasicZoneProcessor pacificProcessor;

static SystemClockLoop systemClock(nullptr /*reference*/, nullptr /*backup*/);

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial); // Wait until Serial is ready - Leonardo/Micro

  systemClock.setup();

  // Creating timezones is cheap, so we can create them on the fly as needed.
  auto pacificTz = TimeZone::forZoneInfo(&zonedb::kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles,
      &pacificProcessor);

  // Set the SystemClock using these components.
  auto pacificTime = ZonedDateTime::forComponents(
      2019, 6, 17, 19, 50, 0, pacificTz);
  systemClock.setNow(pacificTime.toEpochSeconds());
}

void printCurrentTime() {
  acetime_t now = systemClock.getNow();

  // Create a time
  auto pacificTz = TimeZone::forZoneInfo(&zonedb::kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles,
      &pacificProcessor);
  auto pacificTime = ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds(now, pacificTz);
  pacificTime.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();
}

// Do NOT use delay() here.
void loop() {
  static acetime_t prevNow = systemClock.getNow();
  systemClock.loop();
  acetime_t now = systemClock.getNow();
  if (now - prevNow >= 2) {
    printCurrentTime();
    prevNow = now;
  }
}
```

This will start by setting the SystemClock to 2019-06-17T19:50:00-07:00,
then printing the system time every 2 seconds:
```
2019-06-17T19:50:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
2019-06-17T19:50:02-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
2019-06-17T19:50:04-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
...
```

OLED displays with 3 timezones, and automatically adjusts the DST transitions
for all 3 zones:

## System Requirements

### Tool Chain

This library was developed and tested using:

* [Arduino IDE 1.8.9](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [Arduino AVR Boards 1.6.23](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr)
* [Arduino SAMD Boards 1.8.3](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd)
* [SparkFun AVR Boards 1.1.12](https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards)
* [SparkFun SAMD Boards 1.6.2](https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards)
* [ESP8266 Arduino 2.5.2](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
* [ESP32 Arduino 1.0.2](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)
* [Teensydino 1.46](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

It should work with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) but I have
not tested it.

The library works on Linux or MacOS (using both g++ and clang++ compilers) using
the [UnixHostDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/UnixHostDuino) emulation layer.

### Operating System

I use Ubuntu 18.04 for the vast majority of my development. I expect that the
library will work fine under MacOS and Windows, but I have not tested them.

### Hardware

The library is extensively tested on the following boards:

* Arduino Nano clone (16 MHz ATmega328P)
* SparkFun Pro Micro clone (16 MHz ATmega32U4)
* WeMos D1 Mini clone (ESP-12E module, 80 MHz ESP8266)
* ESP32 dev board (ESP-WROOM-32 module, 240 MHz dual core Tensilica LX6)
* SAMD21 M0 Mini (48 MHz ARM Cortex-M0+) (compatible with Arduino Zero) (See
  notes in the [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) for some potential issues.)

I will occasionally test on the following hardware as a sanity check:

* Teensy 3.2 (72 MHz ARM Cortex-M4)
* Mini Mega 2560 (Arduino Mega 2560 compatible, 16 MHz ATmega2560)

### Untested RTC hardware compatibility

As DS1307 and DS3232 RTC chip have exactly same interface as DS3231 for used
features except temperature on DS1307 (this one lacks this functionality),
this class could be be used to control all of them.

Any problem with these RTCs please, contact @Naguissa (https://github.com/Naguissa/AceTime)
