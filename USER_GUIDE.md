# AceTime User Guide

*This file is deprecated.*

The content that used to be in this file was split into multiple files in the
[docs/](docs/) directory. The bulk of the material went into these 2 documents:

* [docs/date_time_timezone.md](docs/date_time_timezone.md)
* [docs/clock_system_clock.md](docs/clock_system_clock.md)

See [README.md](README.md) to get an overview of the new documentation
structure.
