# Memory Benchmark

The `MemoryBenchmark.ino` was compiled with each `FEATURE_*` and the flash
memory and static RAM sizes were recorded. The `FEATURE_BASELINE` selection is
the baseline, and its memory usage  numbers are subtracted from the subsequent
`FEATURE_*` memory usage.

**Version**: AceTime v1.7.5

**DO NOT EDIT**: This file was auto-generated using `make README.md`.

## How to Regenerate

To regenerate this README.md:

```
$ make clean_benchmarks
$ make benchmarks
$ make README.md
```

The `make benchmarks` target uses `collect.sh` script which calls `auniter.sh`
(https://github.com/bxparks/AUniter) to invoke the Arduino IDE programmatically.
It produces a `*.txt` file with the flash and ram usage information (e.g.
`nano.txt`). It now takes about 16 minutes to generate the `*.txt` files on my
quad-core Intel Core i7-3840QM CPU @ 2.80GHz laptop.

The `make README.md` command calls the `generated_readme.py` Python script which
generates this `README.md` file. The ASCII tables below are generated by the
`generate_table.awk` script, which takes each `*.txt` file and converts it to an
ASCII table.

## Library Size Changes

In v1.3:
* The `BasicZoneManager` and `ExtendedZoneManager` classes were unified under a
  new parent interface `ZoneManager`. This seems to have caused the flash size
  to increase by around 1200 bytes on the AVR processors (Nano, Pro Micro),
  about 500 bytes on a SAMD, about 800 bytes on a ESP8266, 100 bytes on a ESP32,
  and 1400 bytes on a Teensy 3.2. The 8-bit processors suffer the most flash
  size increase proportional to their limited 32kB limit.
* Adding the `ZoneManager` interface simplifies a lot of the complexity with
  saving and restoring time zones using the `TimeZoneData` object, and I think
  it is worth the extra cost of flash size. The mitigating factor is that
  applications targetted towards 8-bit processors will normally have fixed
  number of timezones at compile time, so they can avoid using a `ZoneManager`,
  and avoid this penalty in flash size.

In v1.4.1+:
* Removed the `ZoneInfo::transitionBufSize` field from the `ZoneInfo` struct,
  which saves 1 byte on 8-bit processors (none on 32-bit processors due to
  4-byte alignment). We save 266 bytes for `BasicZoneManager` and 386 bytes for
  `ExtendedZoneManager` when all the zones are loaded into the zone registry.
* Incorporated zoneName compression causes flash/ram usage to increase by
  ~250/120 bytes when using only 1-2 zones, but *decreases* flash consumption by
  1200-2400 bytes when all the zones are loaded into the `ZoneManager`.

In v1.5+:
* Changing `ZoneProcessorCache::getType()` from a `virtual` to a non-virtual
  method saves 250-350 bytes of flash memory when using a `BasicZoneManager` or
  an `ExtendedZoneManager` on an 8-bit AVR processor. Unexpectedly, the flash
  memory consumption *increases* slightly (~0-50 bytes) for some ARM processors
  and the ESP32. Since those processors have far more flash memory, this seems
  like a good tradeoff.
* Changing `BasicZoneProcessor` and `ExtendedZoneProcessor` to be subclasses of
  the templatized `BasicZoneProcessorTemplate` and
  `ExtendedZoneProcessorTemplate` classes causes reduction of flash consumption
  by 250-400 bytes for 32-bit processors. Don't know why. (Very little
  difference for 8-bit AVR).
* Adding a `BrokerFactory` layer of indirection (to support more complex
  ZoneProcessors and Brokers) causes flash memory to go up by 100-200 bytes.

In v1.6:
* Added support for `LinkRegistry` to `BasicZoneManager` and
  `ExtendedZoneManager`. This increases the flash memory usage by 150-500 bytes
  when using one of these classes due to the code required by `LinkRegistrar`.
  This extra cost is incurred even if the `LinkRegistry` is set to 0 elements.
  Each `LinkEntry` consumes 8 bytes (2 x `uint32_t`). So a
  `zonedb::kLinkRegistry` with 183 elements uses 1464 extra bytes of flash; a
  `zonedbx::kLinkRegistry` with 207 elements uses 1656 extra bytes.

In v1.7:
* The virtual destructor on the `Clock` base class removed. This reduced the
  flash usage by 618 bytes on AVR processors , 328 bytes on the SAMD21, but only
  50-60 bytes on other 32-bit processors.
* The various `printShortNameTo()` or `printShortTo()` methods changed to
  replace the underscore in the zone names (e.g. `Los_Angeles`) with spaces
  (e.g. `Los Angeles`) to be more human friendly. This made little difference in
  the flash memory consumption, except on the ESP32 where it increased by
  200-300 bytes.

In v1.7.2
* The `SystemClock::clockMillis()` is now non-virtual, using compile-time
  polymorphism through C++ template, and incorporating the same techniques from
  AceRoutine v1.3. Saves about 20-40 bytes of flash.

In v1.7.5:
* `ExtendedZoneProcessor.compareTransitionToMatch()` was modified to
  detect an exact equality between a `Transition` and its `MatchingEra` if any
  of the 3 time stamp versions ('w', 's', 'u') are equal. Adds about 120-150
  bytes of flash on 8-bit and 32-bit processors. But removing
  `originalTransitionTime` from `Transition` decreases flash usage by about 20
  bytes.
* Upgrade ESP8266 Core from 2.7.4 to 3.0.2. Flash consumption increases by
  3-5 kB across the board.
* Upgrade Teensyduino from 1.54 to 1.55. Add memory consumed by `malloc()` and
  `free()` when using classes with virtual methods into baseline
  MemoryBenchmark, reducing the actual memory usage of various features by
  ~3kB.

In v1.7.5+:
* Convert `DS3231.h` into a template class for `<AceWire.h>`, replacing direct
  dependency on `<Wire.h>`.
    * Just including the `<Wire.h>` header causes flash memory to be consumed,
      even if `Wire` object is never used.
    * Saves 1000-1500 bytes of flash on AVR processors.
    * Saves 500 bytes of flash on SAMD.
    * Saves 4000 bytes of flash STM32.
    * Saves 500 bytes of flash on ESP8266.
    * Saves 3000-4000 bytes of flash on ESP32.
    * Saves 2500 bytes of flash on Teensy 3.2.
* MemoryBenchmark:
    * Add benchmark for `DS3231Clock` separatelyfrom `SytemClock`.
    * Replace dependency to `<Wire.h>` with `<AceWire.h>`, reducing the
      apparent flash consumption by 1000-3000 bytes.
    * Rename `SystemClock` label to `SystemClockLoop`.
    * Add benchmarks for `SystemClockCoroutine` separately from
      `SystemClockLoop`.
