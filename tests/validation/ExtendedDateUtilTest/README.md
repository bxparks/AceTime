# ExtendedDateUtilTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneProcessor` class with the `validation_data.cpp` file generated by
the `../../tools/compare_dateutil/generate_data.py` program which uses the
[dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/) library.

## Running the Test

The Python tool generates about 130,000 data points spanning the year 2000 to
2038. It is too large to run on any Arduino board that I am aware of, including
the ESP32.

The unit test does run on a Linux machine using the
[UnixHostDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/UnixHostDuino) adapter layer.
Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:

```
$ make

$ make runtests
