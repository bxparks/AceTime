## Migrating to v1.8.0

Three breaking changes were made from v1.7.5 to v1.8.0:

1) The `SystemClock` and other clock classes were moved to
   [AceTimeClock](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock). This improves the
   decoupling between the AceTime and AceTimeClock libraries and allows
   faster development of each library.
2) The `DS3231Clock` class was converted into a template class to replace a
   direct dependency to the I2C `<Wire.h>` library with an indirect dependency
   to the [AceWire](https://github.com/bxparks/AceWire) library. This reduces
   the flash memory consumption between 1300-2500 bytes on AVR processor
   on applications which use only the AceTime portion of the library, and
   increases the flexibility of the `DS3231Clock` class.
3) Support for [thin links](USER_GUIDE.md#ThinLinks) was moved out of
   `BasicZoneManager` and `ExtendedZoneManager` into the new `BasicLinkManager`
   and `ExtendedLinkManager` classes. This simplifies the ZoneManagers, and
   reduces the flash memory consumption of applications which do not use this
   feature by 200-500 bytes.

The following subsections show how to migrate client application from
AceTime v1.7.5 to AceTime v1.8.0.

### Migrating to AceTimeClock

For AceTime v1.8.0, the clock classes under the `ace_time::clock` namespace have
been moved to the `AceTimeClock` library. To help backwards compatibility,
the namespace of the clock classes remain in the `ace_time::clock` namespace.

To migrate your old code, install `AceTimeClock` using the Arduino Library
Manager. (See [AceTimeClock
Installation](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock#Installation) for more
details). Then update the client code to add the `<AceTimeClock.h>` header
file just after the exiting `<AceTime.h>` header.

For example, if the original code looks like this:

```C++
#include <AceTime.h>
using namespace ace_time;
using namespace ace_time::clock;
```

Replace that with this:

```C++
#include <AceTime.h>
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
using namespace ace_time;
using namespace ace_time::clock;
```

### Migrating the DS3231Clock

For AceTime v1.8.0, the `DS3231Clock` class was converted into a template class
to replace a direct dependency to the `<Wire.h>` library with an indirect
dependency to to the [AceWire](https://github.com/bxparks/AceWire) library.
There were 2 primary motivation for the change.

One, simply including the `<Wire.h>` header file increases the flash memory
usage by ~1300 bytes on AVR, *even* if the `Wire` object is never used. The
`DS3231Clock` class is the *only* class in the AceTime library that depended on
the `<Wire.h>`. So any application that pulled in `<AceTime.h>` for the time
zone classes would suffer the increased flash usage of the `<Wire.h>` library,
even if the `Wire` was never referenced or used in the client application.

Two, the `TwoWire` class from `<Wire.h>` is not designed to be used
polymorphically (see
[SoftwareWire#28](https://github.com/Testato/SoftwareWire/issues/28) for more
details). In other words, it cannot be subclassed and cannot be replaced with
a different implementation of the I2C protocol. If a 3rd party library contains
a direct dependency to the `<Wire.h>` directly, it is impossible to replace the
`Wire` object with a different I2C implementation (for example, one of the
alternative I2C implementations listed in this [Overview of Arduino I2C
libraries](https://github.com/Testato/SoftwareWire/wiki/Arduino-I2C-libraries).
The `<AceWire.h>` library solves this problem by using compile-time polymorphism
through C++ templates.

Here is the migration process. For all occurrences of the old `DS3231Clock`
class that look like this:

```C++
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
using namespace ace_time;
using namespace ace_time::clock;
...
DS3231Clock dsClock;
```

Replace that with a template instance of the `DS3231Clock<T>` class, and its I2C
interface classes (`TwoWire` and `TwoWireInterface`):

```C++
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
#include <AceWire.h> // TwoWireInterface
#include <Wire.h> // TwoWire, Wire
using namespace ace_time;
using namespace ace_time::clock;

using WireInterface = ace_wire::TwoWireInterface<TwoWire>;
WireInterface wireInterface(Wire);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(wireInterface);

void setup() {
  ...
  Wire.begin();
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  ...
}
```

The new `DS3231Clock<T>` class requires more configuration. But in return, we
gain more flexibility and potentially a large reduction of flash memory
consumption if the pre-installed `<Wire.h>` is replaced with a different I2C
implementation.  For example, here is a version of the `DS3231Clock` object
where the `SimpleWireInterface` software I2C class replaces the hardware
`TwoWireInterface` class, without any changes to the `DS3231Clock` class:

```C++
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
#include <AceWire.h>
using namespace ace_time;
using namespace ace_time::clock;

const uint8_t SCL_PIN = SCL;
const uint8_t SDA_PIN = SDA;
const uint8_t DELAY_MICROS = 4;
using WireInterface = ace_wire::SimpleWireInterface;
WireInterface wireInterface(SDA_PIN, SCL_PIN, DELAY_MICROS);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(wireInterface);

void setup() {
  ...
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  ...
}
```

According to the benchmarks at
[AceWire/MemoryBenchmark](https://github.com/bxparks/AceWire/tree/develop/examples/MemoryBenchmark),
using `SimpleWireInterface` instead of the `TwoWire` class reduces flash
consumption by 1500 bytes on an AVR processor. The flash consumption can be
reduced by 2000 bytes if the "fast" version `SimpleWireFastInterface` is used
instead.

### Migrating to LinkManagers

In v1.7.5, [thin links](USER_GUIDE.md#ThinLinks) were activated by adding the
`kLinkRegistrySize` and `kLinkRegistry` parameters to the constructor of
`BasicZoneManager` and `ExtendedZoneManager`, like this:

```C++
BasicZoneManager zoneManager(
    zonedb::kZoneRegistrySize, zonedb::kZoneRegistry,
    zonedb::kLinkRegistrySize, zonedb::kLinkRegistry);

ExtendedZoneManager zoneManager(
    zonedbx::kZoneRegistrySize, zonedbx::kZoneRegistry,
    zonedbx::kLinkRegistrySize, zonedbx::kLinkRegistry);
```

This caused `BasicZoneManager::createForZoneId()` and
`ExtendedZoneManager::createForZoneId()` to perform an additional lookup in the
`kLinkRegistry` if a `zoneId` was not found in the `kZoneRegistry`.

In v1.8.0, that fall-back functionality has been moved to the LinkManagers,
and the ZoneManager constructors no longer accept the link registry parameters:

```C++
BasicLinkManager linkManager(
    zonedb::kLinkRegistrySize, zonedb::kLinkRegistry);

ExtendedLinkManager linkManager(
    zonedbx::kLinkRegistrySize, zonedbx::kLinkRegistry);
```

The client application is now responsible for activating the link registry, and
performing the fallback lookup:

```C++
TimeZone findTimeZone(uint32_t zoneId) {
  TimeZone tz = zoneManager.createForZoneId(zoneId);
  if (tz.isError()) {
    // Search the link registry.
    zoneId = linkManager.zoneIdForLinkId(zoneId);
    if (zoneId != LinkManager::kInvalidZoneId) {
      tz = zoneManager.createForZoneId(zoneId);
    }
  }
  return tz;
}
```

This change allows the ZoneManagers to provide a consistent API for some
upcoming features, and prevents unnecessary flash consumption (200-500 bytes) if
the client application does not use the thin link feature.
