# Auto Benchmark

Here are the results from `AutoBenchmark.ino` for various boards.
These results show that integer division and modulus operations are incredibly
slow on 8-bit AVR processors.

**Version**: AceTime v1.8.0

**NOTE**: This file was auto-generated using `make README.md`. DO NOT EDIT.

## Dependencies

This program depends on the following libraries:

* [AceTime](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime)
* [AceRoutine](https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine)

## How to Generate

This requires the [AUniter](https://github.com/bxparks/AUniter) script
to execute the Arduino IDE programmatically.

The `Makefile` has rules to generate the `*.txt` results file for several
microcontrollers that I usually support, but the `$ make benchmarks` command
does not work very well because the USB port of the microcontroller is a
dynamically changing parameter. I created a semi-automated way of collect the
`*.txt` files:

1. Connect the microcontroller to the serial port. I usually do this through a
USB hub with individually controlled switch.
2. Type `$ auniter ports` to determine its `/dev/ttyXXX` port number (e.g.
`/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`).
3. If the port is `USB0` or `ACM0`, type `$ make nano.txt`, etc.
4. Switch off the old microontroller.
5. Go to Step 1 and repeat for each microcontroller.

The `generate_table.awk` program reads one of `*.txt` files and prints out an
ASCII table that can be directly embedded into this README.md file. For example
the following command produces the table in the Nano section below:

```
$ ./generate_table.awk < nano.txt
```

Fortunately, we no longer need to run `generate_table.awk` for each `*.txt`
file. The process has been automated using the `generate_readme.py` script which
will be invoked by the following command:
```
$ make README.md
```

The CPU times below are given in microseconds.

## CPU Time Changes

v0.8 to v1.4:
* The CPU time did not change much from

In v1.5:
* No significant changes to CPU time.
* Zone registries (kZoneRegistry, kZoneAndLinkRegistry) are now sorted by zoneId
  instead of zoneName, and the `ZoneManager::createForZoneId()` will use a
  binary search, instead of a linear search. This makes it 10-15X faster for
  ~266 entries.
* The `ZoneManager::createForZoneName()` also converts to a zoneId, then
  performs a binary search, instead of doing a binary search on the zoneName
  directly. Even with the extra level of indirection, the `createForZoneName()`
  is between 1.5-2X faster than the previous version.

In v1.6:
* BasicZoneManager and ExtendedZoneManager can take an optional
  LinkRegistry which will be searched if a zoneId is not found. The
  `BasicZoneManager::createForZoneId(link)` benchmark shows that if the zoneId
  is not found, the total search time is roughly double, because the
  LinkRegistry must be search as a fallback.
* On some compilers, the `BasicZoneManager::createForZoneName(binary)` becames
  slightly slower (~10%?) because the algorithm was moved into the
  `ace_common::binarySearchByKey()` template function, and the compiler is not
  able to optimize the resulting function as well as the hand-rolled version.
  The slightly decrease in speed seemed acceptable cost to reduce duplicate code
  maintenance.

In v1.7.2:
* `SystemClock::clockMillis()` became non-virtual after incorporating
  AceRoutine v1.3. The sizeof `SystemClockLoop` and `SystemClockCoroutine`
  decreases 4 bytes on AVR, and 4-8 bytes on 32-bit processors. No signficant
  changes in CPU time.

In v1.7.5:
* significant changes to size of `ExtendedZoneProcessor`
    * 8-bit processors
        * increases by 24 bytes on AVR, due adding 1 pointer and 2
            `uint16_t` to MatchingEra
        * decreases by 48 bytes on AVR, by disabling
            `originalTransitionTime` unless
            `ACE_TIME_EXTENDED_ZONE_PROCESSOR_DEBUG` is enabled.
    * 32-bit processors
        * increases by 32 bytes on 32-bit processors due to adding
            a pointer and 2 `uint16_t` to MatchingEra
        * decreases by 32 bytes on 32-bit processors due to disabling
            `originalTransitionTime` in Transition
* Upgrade ESP8266 Core from 2.7.4 to 3.0.2.
    * AutoBenchmark indicate that things are a few percentage faster.

In v1.8.0:
* Remove `sizeof()` Clock classes which were moved to AceTimeClock library.
* No significant changes to excution times of various benchmarks.
