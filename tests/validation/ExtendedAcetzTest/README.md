# ExtendedAcetzTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneProcessor` class with the `validation_data.cpp` file generated by
the Python `../../tools/compare_acetz/generate_data.py` module which uses the
[acetz](../../../tools/acetz) class.

## Running the Test

The Python tool generates too many data points spanning the year 2000 to 2050.
This test is too large to run on any Arduino board that I am aware of, including
the ESP32.

The unit test does run on a Linux machine using the
[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.
Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:

```
$ make

$ make runtests
