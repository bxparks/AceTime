# BasicHinnantDateTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`BasicZoneProcessor` class (which uses the `zonedb` data files) with the
`validation_data.cpp` file generated by the
[compare_cpp](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeTools/tree/develop/compare_cpp)
program which uses the [Hinnant Date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date)
library.

## Running the Test

Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:
```
$ make clean
$ make -j 4

$ make runtests
TestRunner started on 268 test(s).
Test BasicTransitionTest_Africa_Abidjan passed.
...
Test BasicTransitionTest_WET passed.
TestRunner duration: 0.070 seconds.
TestRunner summary: 268 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 timed out, out of 268 test(s).

$ make clean
```

## Compiling the HinnantDate Test Data Generator

The `Makefile` attempts to compile the
[compare_cpp](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeTools/tree/develop/compare_cpp)
program if necessary. To recompile it manually, type the following:

```
$ cd .../AceTimeTools/compare_cpp
$ make clean
$ make
```
